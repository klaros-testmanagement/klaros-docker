== Introduction

IMPORTANT: This quickstart documentation only covers the Klaros Test Management installation with the Apache Derby database and is only supported for test installations. Do not use it for production systems.
The instructions for the production installation with the database systems MariaDB, MySQL and PostgreSQL can be found https://github.com/klaros-testmanagement/klaros-docker/blob/master/Documentation.adoc[here.]

This installation documentation shows step-by-step how to install and configure Klaros Test Management under Docker for Windows and Linux.

=== About Docker
https://www.docker.com/[Docker] is a free container-based software that allows a secure installation of applications on different operating systems such as Windows and Linux.

You can find further information at https://www.docker.com/why-docker[Why-Docker]

=== About Klaros Test Management
Klaros Test Management is a professional web-based test management software. It contains components for resource management and evaluation of test activity. Tracking of test requirements is supported, as well as agile development processes. Numerous interfaces with issue trackers, test automation tools and continuous integration servers allow seamless integration into existing development environments.

Klaros Test Management is available free of charge in the Community Edition.

The Community Edition can be used without restrictions and has a reduced range of functions.

With no limitation on the number of projects, test cases or users, it is ideal for getting started in a small team.

You can upgrade the Community Edition to the Enterprise Edition at any time by uploading a license file.

The Enterprise Edition offers you the full range of functions, including one year of support and free access to all software updates. Take a look at the Community and Enterprise Edition comparison https://www.klaros-testmanagement.com/en_US/test-management/test-management-tool-comparison[here.]

To receive your free 30-day trial license for the Enterprise Edition, you can request your license key https://www.klaros-testmanagement.com/en_US/trial[here.]

You can find further information at https://www.klaros-testmanagement.com/en_US/[Klaros Test Management.]

== Prerequisites

.Windows
[%collapsible]
====

The current hardware requirements and installation steps are described in the https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/[official Docker documentation.] The Docker Desktop installation requires a login.

To make it easier to update Klaros Test Management later, it is recommended to download the Dockerfile using Git from GitHub.
Git can be downloaded and installed from the https://git-scm.com[official site.]

During the installation you can select whether and how the line endings of files should be converted. Since the server is running on Linux inside the container, and the line endings differ from Windows (\r) and Linux (\n), we recommend to select the option "Checkout as-is, commit Unix-style line endings" or "Checkout as-is, commit as-is".

.Configuration of the line end conversion
image::images/ConfigurationOfTheLineEndConversion.png[Configuration of the line end conversion]

This completes the preparations for Windows. The chapter "Installation" describes how to use Git Bash to download the Dockerfile and prepare it for future updates.
====

.Linux
[%collapsible]
====

See the official Docker documentation for the latest hardware requirements and installation steps.

https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/[Ubuntu Docker]

https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/[Debian Docker]

https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/[CentOS Docker]

https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/install-use-setup-docker-on-rhel7-centos7-linux/[RHEL Docker]

Under CentOS and RHEL, Podman is a popular alternative to Docker. Since Podman provides similar functions as Docker, the code sections with "docker" only need to be replaced by "podman".

Supported https://podman.io/getting-started/installation.html[Podman] version: 1.4.4

https://git-scm.com/[Git] is required to successfully download the Klaros Test Management Dockerfile from GitHub.


.Git installation via Ubuntu/Debian:
----
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
----

.Git installation via CentOS/RHEL:
----
sudo yum check-update
sudo yum install git-core
----


The following command can be used to check whether the installation was successful:
----
git --version
Output: git version 2.20.1
----

This completes the preparations for Linux. The chapter "Installation" describes how the Dockerfile can be downloaded and prepared for future updates.

.Modifiable variables after the first server start via the Dockerfile
[options=""]
|=======================
|TOMCAT_MEMORY_MIN
|TOMCAT_MEMORY_MAX
|JAVA_OPTS
|=======================

=== Configuration via the Dockerfile

Open the Dockerfile under _~/klaros-docker/ApacheDerby_ with the preferred text editor. The Dockerfile contains a list of the configurable ENV variables. See Table 1 for more information.

NOTE: Please make sure that you recreate the image after changing the Dockerfile.

=== Configuration at server startup

Changeable variables can be found in Table 2. The environment variables can be changed with the -e parameter.

.Example
----
sudo docker run --name Klaros -p 18080:18080 -e TOMCAT_MEMORY_MAX='1024' -e <Other Variable> klaros
----

=== Configuration via a file

To specify the configurations via a file, a text file can be created in the ApacheDerby directory. 
Modifiable variables can be found in Table 2. When creating the container, add the --env-file parameter.

.Windows Example
[%collapsible]
====
----
New-Item <Path/env-list.txt> -ItemType file
echo "TOMCAT_MEMORY_MAX=1024" > env-list.txt
sudo docker create --name Klaros -p 18080:18080 --env-file ./env-list.txt klaros
----
====

.Linux Example
[%collapsible]
====
----
touch env-list
echo "TOMCAT_MEMORY_MAX=1024" > env-list
docker create --name Klaros -p 18080:18080 --env-file ./env-list klaros
----
====

== Installation
=== Clone
Once you are in the directory you want, you can start downloading the Dockerfile.
----
git init
git clone https://github.com/klaros-testmanagement/klaros-docker 
----

With "ls" you can check whether the directory was created correctly.
----
ls
Output: klaros-docker
----

=== Build
The image is needed to create the Klaros container and start the server. +
Windows users are switching from Git Bash to Powershell.

----
cd ~/klaros-docker/ApacheDerby
docker build -t klaros .
----

== Usage
=== How to start an instance

During startup, a Docker-Container with the name "Klaros" will be created.

IMPORTANT: An anonymous volume is created when the container is created. If a named volume is desired, then -v must be added as an additional parameter.

.One-time execution: Create a Klaros container (anonymous volume)
----
docker create --name Klaros -p 18080:18080 klaros
----

.One-time execution: Create a Klaros container (named volume)
----
docker create --name Klaros -p 18080:18080 -v klaros-data:/data klaros
----

.Once the container has been created, the server can be booted with "docker start".
----
docker start -a Klaros
----

.To execute the container in detached mode, the -a parameter must be removed.
----
docker start Klaros
----

[%collapsible]
====
You can find further information in the https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/start/[official Docker Documentation.]

After the server has been started, the message "Server startup in x ms" appears at the end. You can now use any browser to enter your IP address and port to access the Klaros website.

----
Username: admin
Password: admin
----

Example: 127.0.0.1:18080

====

Another Klaros instance can be used to check backups for completeness or to test a newer Klaros version.
To create another instance, simply change the container name and port.

.Create a second Klaros instance with its own database
----
docker create --name Klaros2 -p 18081:18080 klaros
----

=== How to shut down your instance

In detached mode, the server must be shut down via "docker stop".
If the container has been started in the foreground, press CTRL + C to return to the terminal and shut down the container automatically. Windows is considered as an exception and the container must be closed via "docker stop".

----
docker stop Klaros
----

== Create, restore and test a backup
Backups are labeled with the name "backup_klaros<date>.tar.gz". If you create several backups per day, it is recommended to specify a time (hours, minutes and seconds) when creating the backups. To do this, add %H(hour), %M(minute), and %S(second) in date/Get-Date.

If an error occurs while creating the backup, the log file provides useful hints.

.Windows Example
----
$(Get-Date -UFormat "%y-%m-%d-%Hh-%Mm-%Ss")
----

.Linux Example
----
$(date '+%y-%m-%d-%H:%M:%S')
----

[%collapsible]
====
This would give the backup the following name:

Windows: backup_klaros19-10-28-11h-34m-33s.tar.gz +
Linux: backup_klaros19-10-28-11:34:33.tar.gz

You can change the backup path using the code section behind -v: "~/klaros-docker/backup"

.Windows Example
----
mkdir ~/klaros-docker/Path/backup
docker run --rm --volumes-from Klaros -v ~/klaros-docker/Path/backup:/backup alpine tar cvzf /backup/backup_klaros$(Get-Date -UFormat "%y-%m-%d").tar.gz /data/klaros-home /data/catalina-base/logs
----

.Linux Example
----
mkdir ~/klaros-docker/Path/backup
sudo docker run --rm --volumes-from Klaros -v ~/klaros-docker/Path/backup:/backup alpine tar cvzf /backup/backup_klaros$(date '+%y-%m-%d').tar.gz /data/klaros-home /data/catalina-base/logs
----
====

=== Creating a backup

.Windows
----
docker stop Klaros
mkdir ~/klaros-docker/backup
docker run --rm --volumes-from Klaros -v ~/klaros-docker/backup:/backup alpine tar cvzf /backup/backup_klaros$(Get-Date -UFormat "%y-%m-%d").tar.gz /data/klaros-home /data/catalina-base/logs
docker start -a Klaros
----

.Linux
----
sudo docker ps
sudo docker stop Klaros
sudo docker run --rm --volumes-from Klaros -v ~/klaros-docker/backup:/backup alpine tar cvzf /backup/backup_klaros$(date '+%y-%m-%d').tar.gz /data/klaros-home /data/catalina-base/logs
sudo docker start -a Klaros
----

=== Restore a Backup

.Note to adjust the date of the respective backups.
----
docker stop Klaros
docker run --rm --volumes-from Klaros -v ~/klaros-docker/backup:/backup alpine /bin/sh -c "cd /data && tar xvzf /backup/backup_klaros19-10-28.tar.gz --strip 1"
docker start -a Klaros
----

=== Test a Backup

To test a backup, you can create a second Klaros instance to play the backup on. The second instance must be fully booted once before the backup can be installed.

----
docker run --name Klaros-test -p 18081:18080 klaros
----

The server is then stopped with CTRL + C or with "docker stop".
----
docker stop Klaros-test
----

.Note to adjust the date of the respective backups.
----
docker run --rm --volumes-from Klaros-test -v ~/klaros-docker/backup:/backup alpine /bin/sh -c "cd /data && tar xvzf /backup/backup_klaros19-10-28.tar.gz --strip 1"
docker start -a Klaros-test
----

If the backup has been successfully tested, the server can be stopped and removed.
----
docker stop Klaros-test
docker rm -v Klaros-test
----

== How and where can I find the log files?

Log files may be required for troubleshooting. To access log files, a shell can be opened directly in the Docker-Container or they can be taken from the backup.

Relevant log files can be found here:

_/data/catalina-base/logs_

=== Show log files via Docker shell
Open a shell with "docker exec" in the Klaros container to get access to the logs.

NOTE: Please note that the server must be started when accessing via the shell and is not shut down.

.The log files can then be read using more
----
docker exec -it Klaros /bin/sh
more /data/catalina-base/logs/catalina.2019-12-09.log
----

=== Show logs from backup

.Windows
[%collapsible]
====
Windows users can use the https://www.winrar.de/downld.php[WinRAR] archive program to extract .tar.gz archives.

Afterwards, the Klaros Test Management logs can be displayed in the "logs" folder of catalina-base.
====

.Linux
[%collapsible]
====
To read the logs from the backup, use tar to unpack the archive.
----
sudo tar -xzf backup_klaros19-10-28.tar.gz
----

Afterwards, the Klaros Test Management logs can be displayed in the "logs" folder of catalina-base.
====

== Update

IMPORTANT: If the update is only for testing purposes, do not use its original branch (klaros or master), otherwise the configurations for the previous version will be lost(You can clone the directory for this). Also make sure to use a different volume and rebuild the old image with "docker-compose build" after testing, so that your original version is not accidentally updated.

Before an update of Klaros Test Management can be performed, a temporary container with the volumes of Klaros must be created.

----
docker stop Klaros
docker create --name Klaros-tmp --volumes-from Klaros alpine
docker rm Klaros
----

=== Update via master branch

Klaros can be updated to the latest version with "git pull".
----
git pull origin master
----

=== Update via tags

To perform an update from an older to a newer version, the first step is to check for new updates in the GitHub repository. Current versions can be displayed via "git tag". Then a local branch "update" with the desired version can be created and merged. Alternatively, you can merge your local branch directly with the master instead of creating a second branch.
----
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git checkout tags/<tag_name> -b update
git checkout klaros
git merge update
git branch -D update
----

=== Refresh image

After downloading the update from the Git repository, the next step is to remove the old image and create a new one.
----
docker rmi klaros
docker build -t klaros .
----

After the new image has been created, the server will be created with the volumes of Klaros-tmp and the temporary container will be removed. Afterwards the server can be started as usual.
----
docker create --name Klaros --volumes-from Klaros-tmp -p 18080:18080 klaros
docker rm Klaros-tmp
docker start -a Klaros
----

== How to use a previous version

NOTE: If a newer version is already in use, then an older version can only be used by creating a new instance or a re-installation.

You can view currently supported versions on https://github.com/klaros-testmanagement/klaros-docker/releases[GitHub releases].

After the repository has been cloned, the tags can be listed with "git tag" and selected as local branch with "git checkout".

----
git tag
git checkout tags/<tag_name> -b klaros
----

== Uninstallation

To completely remove Klaros Test Management from Docker, the container must be stopped first, before the container and volume can be removed.

Then remove the _~/klaros-docker_ directory and the image.
----
docker stop Klaros
docker rm -v Klaros
docker rmi klaros
rm -rf ~/klaros-docker
----
